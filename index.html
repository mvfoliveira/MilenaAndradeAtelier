            	<h3>A little <br>about us...</h3>
           		<p>Hi, I’m Milena Andrade, a Graphic Designer.</p>
            	<p>My business started unexpectedly when I was pregnant, and my husband decided to buy a laser cutting machine. Although I wasn’t thrilled about the purchase, the machine arrived at our home one day. Since it was already there, I decided to use it to create monthly growth milestone markers for our baby. To make up for buying the laser, my husband also gifted me a Cricut for personal paper projects, which I enjoyed. We used the machines casually until our son’s birthday, when I created several decorative elements for the party. </p>
			  <p>Two months after the party, in January 2024, I was supposed to return to work, but on my first day back, I was laid off. I had always wanted to start my own business but never had the time. That layoff was the push I needed to turn my dream into reality.</p>
